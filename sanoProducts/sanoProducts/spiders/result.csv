<p>Big delicious chunks of chocolate-chip cookie dough surrounded by creamy vanilla ice cream. It seems like such a no-brainer today, but in 1984 it was revolutionary.<br/>The Cookie Dough you know and love started with a simple suggestion: What if you put chunks of chocolate-chip cookie dough into vanilla ice cream? That was the amazing anonymous idea submitted way back in the early days of our first Burlington, Vermont, USA, Scoop Shop. We used to have a bulletin board where people could suggest new flavours for Jerry and Ben to make—and this idea stood out. The folks at the Scoop Shop immediately went to work mixing up a batch of Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. It was an instant hit.<br/>Initially, the flavour was only available at the Scoop Shop. When we decided to sell it in tubs, we had to figure out how to get that familiar cookie-dough taste, consistency and texture at ice cream temperatures. We teamed up with local producer Rhino Foods and, over an incredible six-year journey, we perfected the cookie dough found in our tubs today. In 1991, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough began appearing in freezer aisles everywhere.

<p>Chocolate ice cream with gooey marshmallow, caramel swirls and fudge fish. It’s delicious, but how did it come to be?<br/>Ben had been pondering the lack of a good marshmallow ice cream for years. “Most attempts at marshmallow were wispy. You can see the white streaks, but you can't taste them, you can't feel them, you can't experience the true glorious marshmallowness of it all,” Ben remembers.<br/>Well, back in 1995, we suggested to the rock band Phish that we celebrate our shared Vermont, USA, roots by creating a Phish flavour. As the wheel started turning on the collaboration, Ben saw an opportunity to solve the marshmallow conundrum once and for all. Starting with a base of rich chocolate ice cream, he and our flavour gurus started bringing the band test tubs of the evolving concoction. “We ate a lot of test tubs around the table with Phish. We’ve done flavours with other artists and entities, but nobody was more involved in creating the flavour than Phish was,” Jerry says. The band was instrumental, for example, in calling for caramel swirl, an addition that pushed the flavour over the top.<br/>We work with Fairtrade certified producers for cocoa, sugar and vanilla, and our Caring Dairy farmers produce the milk and cream in this tub in a sustainable way. All of Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream is made with non-GMO sourced ingredients and cage-free eggs. Ben &amp; Jerry’s uses responsibly sourced packaging.</p>

<p>Tasting Notes<br/>Spicy, aromatic, rich, textured, French oaked and lingering<br/>
<br/>The Crested porcupines are widely represented in Southern Africa. They are covered in spines and quills which when raised present a formidable fence of sharp spikes. They are noisy animals and move with a ponderous gait accompanied by much snuffling and grunting. A diet of potatoes, pumpkin and root vegetables tend to make them a problem in farming areas. They are, however, nocturnal and shy and the families that reside at Boekenhoutskloof are very welcome.</p>

</div>
<div class=""itemTypeGroup"">
<div class=""memo"">
<p>Viticulture<br/>Vertical shoot positioned, cane pruned vines planted at a density of 2525 plants per hectare. The soil originates from an ancient riverbed, comprised of free draining, stony silts with a silt loam topsoil.<br/>
<br/>Winemaking<br/>Temperature controlled fermentation in stainless steel tanks with carefully selected yeast strains, chosen for their ability to capture the full aromatic intensity and complexity of Waihopai Pinot Grigio.<br/>
<br/>The Colour<br/>The Ned Pinot Grigio signature pale salmon blush.<br/>
<br/>The Aroma<br/>A bouquet of ginger spiced, nectarine and golden skin apples with the delicate floral lift of fresh cut spring flowers.<br/>
<br/>The Palate<br/>Extended skin contact on a selection of the ripest fruit parcels is essential for promoting the signature salmon pink colour of The Ned Pinot Grigio. Equally important is the positive effect this technique has on the wine's depth of flavour and overall mouth feel; balance and drink ability is achieved via a fresh thread of Waihopai acidity and the long, lightly drying tannin tail.<br/>
<br/>Crafted to enjoy whilst young and fresh; we recommend drinking this wine within 2 - 3 years of vintage date.<br/>
<br/>Food Matching<br/>A highly versatile food wine; our Pinot Grigio has been internationally recognised over several vintages as the best wine match for Cantonese Dim Sim.</p>
</div>
<div class=""memo"">
<p>Situated in the Waihopai Valley of Marlborough, the Marisco Vineyards comprise of a complex range of soils running across ancient river bed terraces with a unique climate. This combination of soils and climate allows us to produce classic styles of Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Grigio - showing elegance and fruit purity.</p>

<p>Vanilla ice cream with a chocolatey cookie swirl, chocolatey cookie sandwiches and cookie dough chunks. It’s Cookie Dough, with even more cookie.<br/>The Cookie Dough you know and love started with a simple question: What if you put chunks of chocolate-chip cookie dough into vanilla ice cream? That was the amazing anonymous idea submitted way back in 1984, during the early days of our first Burlington, Vermont, USA, Scoop Shop. The folks at the Scoop Shop immediately went to work mixing up a batch of Cookie Dough ice cream. It was an instant hit.<br/>It took seven years of delicious, if painstaking, work to bring Cookie Dough to freezer aisles everywhere. Why? We had to make sure it was perfect. In 2016, 25 years after that signature moment in dessert history, we started wondering, “How can we make Cookie Dough even cookier?” So we turned the cookie-o-meter right up to eleven to concoct this new Cookie Dough S’Wich Up: Vanilla ice cream with chocolatey cookie sandwiches, a swirl of chocolatey cookies (and of course, cookie-dough chunks!). We think it’s cookie sandwich-tastic…and hope you do, too! Cookies and ice cream…good together, any ‘Wich way!<br/>We work with Fairtrade certified producers for cocoa, sugar, and vanilla. All of Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream is made with free range eggs, and we use responsibly-sourced packaging.</p>

<p>A delectable dance of Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough and Chocolate Fudge Brownie. Vanilla ice cream and chocolate ice cream with chunks of cookie dough and fudge brownies—it’s hard to imagine a better combination.<br/>
<br/>Ben &amp; Jerry’s Half Baked—which got its name because the cookie dough isn’t baked, but the brownies are—has been a bestselling flavor since we first decided to combine our classic ice cream creations back in 2000.<br/>
<br/>Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, with big chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough surrounded by vanilla ice cream, was created back in 1984 at our very first Scoop Shop after we received an anonymous fan’s flavor suggestion. It continues as a flavor phenomenon to this very day. Chocolate Fudge Brownie is a fan-favourite chocolate extravaganza, mixing chocolate ice cream with ridiculously delicious Greyston Bakery brownies. It’s been satisfying chocolate lovers since 1991. We know it can be hard to choose between those two legendary flavors. With Half Baked, you don’t have to!<br/>
<br/>We work with Fairtrade certified producers for all the cocoa, sugar, and vanilla in our recipes. Our Caring Dairy farmers produce all the certified kosher milk and cream in a sustainable way. Greyston Bakery, one of the largest social enterprises in the US, provides the scrumptiuous brownies for this and all of our frozen dessert flavors. All our ice cream is made with non-OGM sourced ingredients and cage-free eggs. This ice cream pint, like every pint we make, features responsibly sourced packaging.</p>

But the story of how this flavour came to be is nearly as sweet. In 2001, New York Times reporter Abby Ellin visited Ben &amp; Jerry’s HQ in Burlington, VT, USA, with several other journalists. Each reporter worked with a Flavour Guru to invent their very own flavour. And although the recipe for Abby’s flavour was never committed to memory, her unforgettable name certainly stuck: Karamel Sutra!<br/>With Abby’s permission, Karamel Sutra joined our special collection of 2002 Core Concoction flavours. With its velvety core of soft caramel encircled by chocolate and caramel ice creams with fudge chips, this stuff was made for pint-tunnelers everywhere. So whether you dig straight down into the core or mix a bit of everything in each bite, tip your spoon to Abby and our Flavour Gurus as you savour this sultry blend.<br/>All of Ben &amp; Jerry’s cocoa, sugar, and vanilla comes from Fairtrade certified producers. The milk and cream in this tub come from Caring Dairy farmers. Our ice cream is made with free range eggs and we always use responsibly-sourced packaging.</p>

<p>About Claudi &amp; Fin lollies:<br/>Lucy and Meriel created Claudi &amp; Fin natural lollies when their children, Claudia &amp; Fin were tiny. Realising they couldn't find any alternatives to the sugar and additive-laden lollies in the shops, they set about creating their own in their kitchens, using only natural ingredients and lots of juicy fruit.<br/>Every Claudi &amp; Fin product is approved by Claudia &amp; Fin and a panel of taste-testers large and small.</p>
